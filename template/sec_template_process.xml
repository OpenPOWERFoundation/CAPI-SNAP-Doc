      <para>The <citetitle>OpenPOWER Foundation Work Group (WG) Process</citetitle> document
      found in the OpenPOWER Foundation Members Community documents is the definitive guide for understanding 
      OpenPOWER Foundation documents and their work flow. Details such as the duration and types of reviews as 
      well as approval voting specifics are found in this document.</para>
      
      <para>This section of the guide does not attempt to provide process details, but instead strives to
      provide an overview to help writers understand enough of the basics to know how to prepare their
      document and what to expect as they proceed through various stages of document development from first
      draft to publication.</para>
      
      <para>The first key concept to understand about OpenPOWER Foundation documents and the first
      decision to make when creating a new document is available document types or "Work Products".
      These fall into one of two categories -- Standards Track or Non-standards Track -- with the simple
      distinguishing factor being use.  If the purpose of a document is to define a specification or standard
      for hardware or software, then the document is "Standards Track".  Everything else is "Non-standards
      Track."  For example, this document is a Non-Stardard Work Product as noted on the title page
      and the lower right corner of every subsequent page.</para>
      
      <para>Non-standard Track Work Products exist simply as Work Group Notes.  Their document
      lifecycle follows this simplified workflow:</para>
      
      <figure pgwide="1" xml:id="project_process_non-std_track_label">
        <title>Overview of Non-standard Track Work Products</title>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="figures/project_process_non-std_track_graphic.svg" format="SVG" scalefit="1" width="100%" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure> 

      <para>Non-standard Track, Work Group Notes begin as Drafts and drop the "Draft" annotation once reviewed. As shown
      in the figure, the document lifecycle always returns to a "Draft" form for updates and new versions as needed.</para>
      
      <para>At any step in cycle, these documents may have security classifications as Public (non-confidential), Members-only
      (OpenPOWER Foundation Confidential), or Work-Group only (OpenPOWER Work Group Confidential) which will
      in turn dictate the review context (public or private).</para>

      <?hard-pagebreak?>
      
      <para>Standards Track Work Products begin their life as Work Group Specification and may ultimately
      become an OpenPOWER Standard.  Their document lifecycle is defined in the following illustration:</para>      

      <figure pgwide="1" xml:id="project_process_std_track_label">
        <title>Overview of Standard Track Work Products</title>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="figures/project_process_std_track_graphic.svg" format="SVG" scalefit="1" width="100%" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure> 

      <para>Standard Track Work Products begin their lives as Work Group Specifications and have security classifications
      of Public (non-confidental),
      Members-only (OpenPOWER Foundation Confidental), or Work Group-only (OpenPOWER Work Group Confidential).
      The security classification impacts the review type -- either public or internal to the Foundation -- as appropriate.
      Only Work Group Specifications classified as Public may proceed into OpenPOWER Standard Documents.  Confidential
      documents will remain Work Group Specifications.</para>
      
      <para>The following sections will provide additional details about how to control the document markings
      and what the process that dictates those markings:</para>

        <para>Once the document type decision has been made (Work Group Note or Work Group Specification),
        two additional markings must be considered during the documentation process: the document confidentiality and
        the document status.  The next section, 
        <xref linkend="section_template_process_flowchart" endterm="section_template_process_flowchart_title"/>, 
        details how these values will change during the publishing process.  But, before diving into the process,
        let us see what values in the document <literal>pom.xml</literal> file play a role in the document
        development process.</para>
        <para>The document Work Product categorization, security classification, and document status are reflected 
        in the following ways:</para>

            <para>As stated in the comment text of the book file, the first paragraph provides a typical abstract

            text which should be updated with the appropriate Work Group name, Work Product type,
            and Work Product process.  The rest of the information in this paragraph should remain as-is.</para>

        <para>The only Non-Standard Track Work Product <literal>&lt;workProduct&gt;</literal> setting is <literal>workgroupNotes</literal>.
        Documents in this track have this value set and never changed.</para>
        
        <para>During the work flow progression of the document, a common decision point for the Non-Standard Track Work Product 
        centers on <literal>&lt;security&gt;</literal> settings.  Documents may be marked as <literal>public</literal> 
        just prior to review or prior to approval.  Each work
        group will need to review their charter and determine whether public release of their work products is expected or allowed.</para>
        
        <para>The <literal>&lt;documentStatus&gt;</literal> variable tracks quite simply through the work flow, beginning as
        <literal>draft</literal>, transitioning to <literal>review</literal>, and finishing as <literal>published</literal> when finished.</para>
        
        <para>A feature which makes a Non-Standard Track document unique is that the Work Group is the only approver prior to publish
        as a Work Group Note.  As will be seen in the next figure, Standard Track Work Products often require multiple reviews.</para>
        
        <para>The following flowchart expands upon the Standard Track Work Product lifecycle
        first introduced in <xref linkend="project_process_std_track_label"/>.  Document markings and key
        process decisions and approvals reflect a more complex process than the previous one for Non-Standard Work Products.</para>

        <para>Like Non-Standard Track Work Products, Standard Track documents frequently evaluate the appropriate security setting.  
        Unlike them, Standard Track Work Products involve many more steps, require numerous approval cycles, and ultimately create
        a public document (<literal>&lt;security&gt;public&lt;/security&gt;</literal>) when they become a 
        Candidate OpenPOWER Standard Work Product.</para>

        <para>While the <literal>&lt;workProduct&gt;</literal> type has a value of <literal>workgroupSpecification</literal>, 
        the <literal>&lt;documentStatus&gt;</literal> variable progress as expected -- beginning as
        <literal>draft</literal>, transitioning to <literal>review</literal>, and finishing as <literal>published</literal>.</para>
        
        <para>Unlike the Non-Standard Work Product, the <literal>&lt;workProduct&gt;</literal> variable begins as 
        <literal>workgroupSpecification</literal>, but may
        transition to <literal>candidateStandard</literal> as it is proposed to be a Candidate OpenPOWER Standard Work Product
        and ultimately becomes <literal>openpowerStandard</literal> if the document is approved as an OpenPOWER Standard Work Product.
        In these latter work flow stages, the <literal>&lt;documentStatus&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;security&gt;</literal>remain as 
        <literal>published</literal> and <literal>public</literal> respectively and never change.
        However, it is work noting that a document may simply exist as a Work Group Specification Work Product for its whole
        lifecycle.  Progression through Candidate OpenPOWER Standard to OpenPOWER Standard is an optional step.</para>
