      <para>The purpose of this document is to describe how to enable a new customer card to support CAPI SNAP framework. SNAP is a open-source programming framework for FPGA Accelerations. Its homepage is <link xlink:href="https://github.com/open-power/snap">https://github.com/open-power/snap</link>. With it, you can develop accelerators with CAPI technology easily.</para>
      
      <para>This document describes the flow and steps to enable a new PCIe FPGA card to be able to run in CAPI2.0 mode, and to support SNAP framework. If your PCIe FPGA card is not listed on today's available "SNAP enabled cards" (On the homepage README of <link xlink:href="https://github.com/open-power/snap">SNAP Github</link>), this document will guide you on <emphasis role="bold">how to enable it</emphasis>. Since all of the project files are open-source, you can create a Github repository fork, and create a new board support package (BSP) and walk through the working flow to enable SNAP. </para>
